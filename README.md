# Calculator

## Instructions:
1. Open the [Calculator](https://calculator-by-eleni.netlify.app/)
2. Calculate to your heart's content


### What I have used:
- HTML
- CSS including Flexbox and Grid
- Inline JavaScript


### What I have learned:
- Creating functions for operators and calculations
- Using querySelectorAll and event listeners for each button on the calculator
- Repeating linear gradient
- Using Regex to recognise operators
- Using pointer-events where there is a picture on a button


### Improvements to be made:
- Only registering the last operator pressed
- Repeating the last calculation if user presses "="
- Only one "0" at the start or "." in elementString even if user presses repeatedly
- Backspace button
- Keyboard controls
